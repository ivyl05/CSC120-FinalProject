**Design justification:**

I chose to design a farm game inspired by my favorite game, HayDay, which is also a farming game. I wanted to explore a different concept than the text-based game introduced in class. While the design of this game was the only concept I considered, the rules changed several times as it was being designed. It is very challenging to have perfect game logic from the start, so I only knew what all the rules would be toward the end of designing the project.

**What was your overall approach to tackling this project?**

Initially, I outlined the game's logic and wrote down all relevant classes and their possible methods in a Google Doc. Although I started with many classes, such as a machine class with several subclasses for different food types, I realized inheritance was not helpful for this structure. Instead, I can make all types of food in one class instead. Similarly, instead of separate classes for each type of crop and seed, I used a hashtable to store them. I wrote all the other classes before I wrote the main class. Since a game is very complicated, I figured out that starting writing the code and testing it is very useful. 

**What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?**

One thing I learned that is particularly useful is the try switch block. It is very efficient and useful and is used in multiple classes in my code. I also learned to use Timer and TimerTask. It allowed me to create a timer which made the game more interesting. It is implemented in multiple classes as well. 

**Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?**

I spent a lot of time planning out the game without writing actual code, but it was not too helpful. I noticed writing out code and solving problems as I wrote it allowed me to have a better idea of designing this game. Writing code and testing it out was more useful than planning it in a Google doc. Therefore, I wish I had start writing out code earlier. 

**If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?**

I would add visualizations to this game. I would also improve the user experience, such as avoiding too much text displayed all at once. 

**What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?**

I think brainstorming with Jordan was very helpful. He advised me to use hashtables for many of the variables, which turned out to make the code much more efficient. 

**If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?**

I would encourage myself and tell myself that I can do it! I chose to work by myself, so in the beginning, I was lost and didn’t know where to start. I couldn’t imagine how I could complete this project. However, eventually, I was able to finish designing my game, and it is showcased on demo day where many others got to play my game. So I would tell myself it is doable and to start writing code and fix any problems as I write it. 


**If you worked with a team: please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project.**
I worked by myself. My experience is that it is difficult since I don't have anyone to discuss and design the game together, but is still doable.
